# git-STEP1
The repository for all code for the First Solar Thermal Energy Planner (STEP1) project.

## What is STEP1?
STEP1 is a webtool that will assist industrial factories with decisions on what type of heat to use.

## Why is STEP1 important?
STEP1 will be pivitol in helping the industry decarbonize with cleaner energy sources such as Concentrated Solar Power, all while helping to save money with energy sources.

## Breakdown of STEP1 webtool application
### Frontend
  - This code compiles what you see on your screen when using the STEP1 webtool
  - The frontend consists of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
### Backend
  - This code helps the frontend of the STEP1 webtool and the API to communicate
  - The backend consists of mainly python code
### API
  - The API is where all of the work is really happening for STEP1
  - This is where statistical modelling and complex computational methods live for STEP1
  - The API is written in Julia and Python
